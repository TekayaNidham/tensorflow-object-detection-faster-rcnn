## Object Detection with MobileNetSSDv2 and Faster R-CNN and the TensorFlow Object Detection API

Thannks to https://github.com/Tony607/object_detection_demo for the intial demo!

## What is contained in this repo

* A tutorial to train and use MobileNetSSDv2 with the TensorFlow Object Detection API
* A tutorial to train and use Faster R-CNN with the TensorFlow Object Detection API 

## What you will learn (MobileNetSSDv2)

* How to load your custom image detection from Roboflow (here we use a public blood cell dataset with tfrecord)
* Download base MobileNetSSDv2 model
* Set up training environment
* Configure training pipeline and train the model
* Export the trained model's .pb inference graph
* Use the saved model for inference

## What you will learn (Faster R-CNN) 

* How to load your custom image data from Roboflow (here we use a public blood cell dataset with tfrecord)
* Download base pretrained Faster R-CNN model
* Set up training environment
* Configure training pipeline and train model
* Export the trained model's .pb inference graph
* Use the saved model for inference
